# Overview üöÄ
This project was developed as the final assignment for the Spring 2025 Database Design course (COMP 267) at North Carolina A&T. Implemented as a console-based Python application,
it simulates a class roster system with two user roles: students and managers.

Students can add, drop, and view their own classes, while managers have the ability to perform these actions on behalf of any student. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate 
how a database integrates with an application, while also implementing basic authentication and authorization mechanisms.
